Will things be different this time? There are cracks in the regime but I don't see the realistic and probable scenario that would result in driving Lukashenko from power this soon. So far it is not a revolution, only a mass protests as a political analyst and journalist from Minsk Artyom Shraibman wrote [here](https://carnegie.ru/commentary/82473): 
>"The authorities’ blocking of both the internet and the center of the capital Minsk, the lack of protest leaders, and the clear advantage of the authorities in terms of strength made a repetition of Ukraine’s Maidan revolution impossible in Belarus right from the start. These are protests of mass rage, not an attempt at regime change."

And it doesn't look like that is a one unified movement with well-defined leadership and political agenda, as Shraibman wrote:
>"Meanwhile, the opposition has no leaders or center that officials could co-opt. It would be wrong to assume that Tikhanovskaya or her team had anything to do with the protests. Meeting points for protesters were designated by the administrators of popular opposition channels on the secure messaging app Telegram. "

Despite some resignations of police officers as a sign of protest Lukashenko still has a control over powerful security services. Over the years he has design many mechanisms to ensure that power stays in his hands. I read several analysis from various srces since it is not good to rely o single source but for good explanation of this mechanisms I could recommend especially the ["The House That Lukashenko Built"](https://carnegieendowment.org/files/CP328_Shraibman_Belarus_FINAL.pdf) also by Shraibman. 

As he wrote:
>"It’s impossible so far to predict with certainty how this political crisis will end. If the protests fizzle out under pressure from the security services—which currently looks like the most probable scenario—it’s unlikely that the authorities will refrain from inflicting a retaliatory blow."
